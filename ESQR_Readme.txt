-The function Run_ESQR(R) derives the 
ESQR estimation of the subjective quality 
from the matrix of noisy ratings R. The entry 
(i,j) of R report the rating of subject j for
 the stimulus i. 

- Use the function Run_ESQR_sparse(R) if R is not a 
full matrix, that is, R contains NaN due to the fact that 
a subject did not rate some stimuli

- Run the code Reproduce_Paper_Results.m to reproduce the paper results.
